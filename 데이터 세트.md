- Punching: In the production line of the strip, the steel strip needs to be punched according to the
product specifications; mechanical failure may lead to unwanted punching, resulting in punching
defects.
- Welding line: When the strip is changed, it is necessary to weld the two coils of the strip, and the
weld line is produced. Strictly speaking, this is not a defect, but it needs to be automatically
detected and tracked to be circumvented in subsequent cuts.
- Crescent gap: In the production of steel strip, cutting sometimes results in defects, just like half
a circle.
- Water spot: A water spot is produced by drying in production. Under different products and
processes, the requirements for this defect are different. However, because the water spots are
generally with low contrast, and are similar to other defects such as oil spots, they are usually
detected by mistake.
- Oil spot: An oil spot is usually caused by the contamination of mechanical lubricant, which will
affect the appearance of the product.
- Silk spot: A local or continuous wave-like plaque on a strip surface that may appear on the upper
and lower surfaces, and the density is uneven in the whole strip length direction. Generally,
the main reason lies in the uneven temperature of the roller and uneven pressure.
- Inclusion: Inclusion is a typical defect of metal surface defects, usually showing small spots,
fish scale shape, strip shape, block irregular distribution in the strip of the upper and lower surface
(global or local), and is often accompanied by rough pockmarked surfaces. Some inclusions are
loose and easy to fall off and some are pressed into the plate.
- Rolled pit: Rolled pits are periodic bulges or pits on the surface of a steel plate that are punctate,
flaky, or strip-like. They are distributed throughout the strip length or section, mainly caused by
work roll or tension roll damage.
- Crease: A crease is a vertical transverse fold, with regular or irregular spacing across the strip, or
at the edge of the strip. The main reason is the local yield along the moving direction of the strip
in the uncoiling process.
- Waist folding: There are obvious folds in the defect parts, a little more popular, a little like
wrinkles, indicating that the local deformation of the defect is too large. The reason is due to
low-carbon.
