# Steel-Surface-Defect-Detection

GC10-DET is the surface defect dataset collected in
a real industry. It contains ten types of surface defects, i.e., punching (Pu), weld line (Wl), crescent gap
(Cg), water spot (Ws), oil spot (Os), silk spot (Ss), inclusion (In), rolled pit (Rp), crease (Cr), waist folding
